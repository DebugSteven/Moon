## About Me

My name is Steven & I'm a Haskell Developer! I’ve worked as a professional Rust developer & worked on open source projects in Rust at the Recurse Center. Besides writing code, I love organizing community. Currently I co-organize the [Boulder/Denver Rust Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-Boulder-Denver/).

Previously, I organized a [Haskell Book](http://www.haskellbook.com) Club in Denver & online while self studying Haskell themselves. I facilitated discussions to help programmers of all experience levels learn Haskell. I completed the entire book in May 2018 with the group & did another iteration in the Fall of 2018. I got completed my Bachelor’s in Computer Science from the University of Colorado at Denver in May 2017.

## Frequently Asked Questions

_Pronouns?_
they/them or he/him

Here is a useful guide to use they pronouns if you are new to them: [pronoun.is/they](https://pronoun.is/they/.../themselves)

_Why is your username DebugSteven?_

DebugSteven was a handle I originally used to figure out some feelings
about my own gender. If I had been assigned male at birth I would've
been named Steven & now I've chosen it for myself. I've joked that all
I do is fix bugs or you know, debug, and DebugSteven rolled off the
tongue.
